# Treehouse Cage Match

# Description

An application to challenge your friends who are also learning to code to a battle of epic proportions. You can type in your name and a friends name, as long as they also have a Team Treehouse profile, and the application will compare your points and display the person who has earned the most points. Underneath the winner is a beautifully bootstrapped display of all of the winner's Treehouse badges that they've earned.
